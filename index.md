## Presentation

I work at Aesthetic Integration in Austin, Texas, on
[Imandra](https://www.imandra.ai/), where I help
write a user friendly, powerful proof system based
on computational logic. I moved to Austin, Texas in January 2018.

Previously (2015-10 to 2017-10) I was at Inria Nancy doing a postdoc
with [Jasmin Blanchette](http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/)
on a counter-example finder for higher order logic,
[nunchaku](https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku/).

I completed my PhD after 3 years at
[Deducteam (INRIA)](http://deducteam.gforge.inria.fr/ "deducteam page"),
from October 2012 to September 2015,
under the supervision of
[Gilles Dowek](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Gilles.Dowek/) and
[Guillaume Burel](http://www.ensiie.fr/~guillaume.burel/).
My work takes place in the field of first-order automated
deduction.
My thesis is titled
"Extending Superposition with Integer Arithmetic,
 Structural Induction, and Beyond" and can be found below.

Before the PhD, I was a student in
[École polytechnique](http://polytechnique.fr), in France,
where I obtained an engineering diploma in 2012,
then at
[EPFL](http://epfl.ch "EPFL website"), in Switzerland, where I got a master
degree in **Computer Science**.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, formal logic, programming
languages; classical music and opéra, science-fiction and more generally
by reading.

I used to be a member of the
[Binet Réseau](http://www.polytechnique.fr/eleves/binets/reseau/Accueil "Binet Réseau"),
an association in charge of the students' network in École polytechnique.

## Computer science

* Research engineer at [Veridis](http://veridis.loria.fr/) with
  Jasmin Blanchette, on model finding for higher-order logic.
* PhD thesis at [Deducteam](http://deducteam.gforge.inria.fr/)
  with Gilles Dowek and Guillaume Burel, on the topic of automated
  theorem proving.
* A 3 months and a half internship at the [ProVal](http://proval.lri.fr/ "laboratoire ProVal") lab in INRIA. The topic was about integrating `TPTP` provers in the [Why](http://why.lri.fr/ "why") software.
* 6 months internship in the Computer Science Lab in [SRI International](http://csl.sri.com "SRI International").
* I'm interested in the technology of _SAT solvers_. More about it on
 [SAT](sat.html "sat"). I'm also interested in first-order _automated theorem
 provers_ (in particular the technology of superposition, e.g.
 the provers [E](http://eprover.org) and [SPASS](http://www.spass-prover.org/)). I develop my own superposition prover, [zipperposition](https://github.com/c-cube/zipperposition/), as a research test bed.
* I converted the so called ["Pelletier problems"](http://www.springerlink.com/content/r10030507w282122/) (some small logical problems designed to test automated provers) in the [TPTP](http://tptp.org) format. The result is now [in Zipperposition](https://github.com/c-cube/zipperposition/tree/master/examples/pelletier_problems). The problem 28 is mistranslated (it seems to be satisfiable), although I could not find why. The last problems are not all translated.

  SMS database (say, after a backup) to a XML file that
  [SMS backup-restore](http://android.riteshsahu.com/apps/sms-backup-restore)
  can read back. **NO GUARANTEE** of it working at all, use at your own risk!

  of the file they point to.
